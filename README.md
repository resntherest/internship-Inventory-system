#  IT Department Inventory Monitoring System


This project is designed to help monitor all items that are **sent, borrowed, or officially assigned** within an organization’s IT department. It serves as a digital logbook—tracking **what item was moved, who received it, when it was dispatched, and when it was returned**.

Whether an asset is going **in** or **out**, this system ensures transparency, accountability, and smooth internal operations.
